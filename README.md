# Design and Simulation of Split L1 Cache - PSU ECE 585

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the comprehensive work done for the PSU class project ECE 585: Microprocessor System Design, focusing on the design and simulation of a split L1 cache. It explores the implementation and evaluation of MESI protocol operations within a simulated microprocessor environment, aiming to optimize cache coherence and improve system performance.

## Key Components
- **MESI Operations**: Detailed simulations and analysis of MESI protocol operations for maintaining cache coherence.
- **Simulation Results**: Includes `Demo_mode0_output.txt` showcasing the simulation output and `combined_results` directory for aggregated data.
- **Documentation**: Found within the `docs` directory, containing detailed documentation on the project's design choices, implementation, and results.
- **Test Cases**: Located in the `testcases` directory, providing robust scenarios used to validate the cache design and MESI protocol implementation.
- **Source Code**: The `src` directory contains all source files used in the project's simulation and analysis.
