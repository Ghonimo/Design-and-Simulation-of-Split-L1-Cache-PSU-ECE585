1.	Open the command prompt by clicking on the start icon, searching for "cmd," and opening it.

2.	Type "cd" followed by a space and the folder extension where the .exe file is located. For example: 
	cd C:\Users\Desktop\Winter_2023\ECE_585\Project.

3.	Type the name of the .exe file, followed by a space, then the name of the trace file, and press enter. For example:
	t1cache_c.exe test2.txt.

4.	The t1_cache_c.exe program combines the data and instruction cache statistics, while the t1_cache_s.exe program keeps the data 			and instruction cache statistics separate.

5.	Choose the mode and press enter.

6.	Repeat the process for other trace files if needed.

Please note that the larger size files (2,202KB) include the necessary dll files built-in, which can sometimes trigger a false positive virus alarm. We have researched this issue and found that it is not an actual virus. The smaller size file (90KB) does not include the dll files built-in. It will work perfectly if the user has the Visual Studio redistribution installed on their computer, as well as the necessary dll files. If not, please run the larger size file. If you encounter any issues running the program, please reach out to our team. We have thoroughly tested these files hundreds of times!
